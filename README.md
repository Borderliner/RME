# RME: Ryan's Minimal Emacs

## Overview
RME is a set of configuration files for GNU Emacs, which aims to be minimal, beautiful, and fast. It's also very modular, so you can easily enable/disable the features you want. I try to keep it as much documented as I can.


Going through the config files is highly recommended.

## Installation

```
mv ~/.emacs.d ~/.emacs.d.bak
git clone https://github.com/Borderliner/rme ~/.emacs.d
```
